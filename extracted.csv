0,several people standing on stage with a projection screen in the background," Next slide. Let's give them a warm welcome. Thank you. Alright, so we're going to the next slide. One thing we wanted to talk about is academia. So, in exploring research, we saw two main problems. The first one was that most investments in scientific research failed to materialize. And this was supposed to be on the in-capital allocation. Another big part was funding demand versus fund received. Over the past about 20 years or so, it's been inversely proportional. So we really want to solve that. So after pivoting our idea six times, here we are with Connexci. Yeah, so you might be wondering, well, what is this that you're looking at? Well, it's a graph structure. What we've basically done with Conneci is we've parsed the web for over 450,000 different papers across all aspects of academia with a primary focus in computer science for the sake of this demo. From there, we're able to identify key articles and publishments that are actually representative of the greater field. So, we've done that. We've done that. We've done that. We've done that.

1800,there are two men standing on a stage with microphones," So that's indicated by the big nodes. Now the question is, what is this fitness? Well, that's where the beauty of the graph structure comes in. Using graph structural elements such as the depth of the graph or different node features, looking at closely related neighbors and their independent node properties, we're able to develop relationships between these graphs. And as you can see, we can parse that and identify the points of research that are absolutely essential for the development of growth and that can propel us to solve the location problem in capital allocation. And another part of this as well is that this is also a very robust model where we can add any kinds of nodes that we want. So say that I wanna add my own node. We have this little feature of, you can copy any article on the internet and we're going to paste it as an additional node. And once we submit it, we've developed a web scripting technique that's going to give us metadata about this article. So this is from the DOI, which if you guys are researchers you probably know what that is, but it's just an index.",store/connexsci-live.mp4_fragment_1800_compressed.mp4,"[{'summary_text': ""Using graph structural elements such as the depth of the graph or different node features, looking at closely related neighbors and their independent node properties, we're able to develop relationships between these graphs.

3600,there are two people standing in front of a screen with information on it," And then we can take that and if you notice we also have search functionality that allows you to see citations other figures and then you have links that allow you to see the connections between this node and the rest of the network and At the bottom we can talk a little more about a few challenges Primarily this was a case with connections where if they're arbitrary like publishers or specific authors, they don't give real data This is where CodeHear comes in. Shout out to CodeHear by the way, we love them so much publishers or specific authors, they don't give real data. This is where CodeHear comes in. Shout out to CodeHear by the way, we love them so much. So we used two models from CodeHear actually. Our main goal was to create a metting which would allow us to compare two documents together, or the abstracts of two documents together, to create or predict new edges in the graph. So first off we would essentially extract a topic from an abstract using a method known as entity extraction and from that we created our own label.",store/connexsci-live.mp4_fragment_3600_compressed.mp4,"[{'summary_text': ""This was a case with connections where if they're arbitrary like publishers or specific authors, they don't give real data.

5400,there are three people standing in front of a screen with pictures on it," which we would use to train an embedding, are actually fine-tuning one of Coheer's existing embedding models, and that allowed us to use a metric known as cosine similarity to measure the angle between two vectors, or document vectors, and place them as new edges, or update the weights of edges on this graph to make it more accurate and richer with context based on the semantics of the documents. Yeah, so how do we actually invest in these research papers? So essentially we have a quadratic funding model which essentially allows or essentially expands the, I guess you could say the stakeholders and the research market ranging from students to organizations to even companies to get into the world of academia. So how does the quadratic funding model actually work in this case? Essentially let's just say given a research company with",store/connexsci-live.mp4_fragment_5400_compressed.mp4,"[{'summary_text': 'Coheer uses a metric known as cosine similarity to measure the angle between two vectors, or document vectors, and place them as new edges.

7200,there are two men standing in front of a screen with a sign," is going to actually end up happening is that the amount of money they actually make is going to be the salvation of all the contributions from contributors. Well, what about monopoly? Because monopoly is a core con of the quadratic funding. So what we've implemented is a taxation system, which we take a percentage or a certain percentage of what they make and they crowdfunding to contributors, allowing a lot of smart researchers to gain an equal chance to grow as well as also be spotlighted throughout the whole world. Alright, and most importantly, our tech sacks. So first of all, we have Anush and Dehir, who worked on machine learning, one of our jobs there. Myself, I worked on the interface, and we have Jeyba right here, I worked on the interface and we have Jabel right here who worked on the graph and math. Above all, we're going to increase the value of public research in the public sector and just put the public to it. So my name is Rajan Agarwal. And my name is Dave Patel.
