One thing we wanted to talk about is academia.  So in exploring research, we saw two main problems.  The first one was that most investments in scientific research failed to materialize,  and this was supposed to be on a capital location.  Another big part was funding demand was finally received.  Over the past about 20 years or so, it's been increasingly proportional.  So we really want to solve that. So after pivoting our ideas six times,  here we are with Connexi.  Yeah, so you might be wondering, well, what is this that you're looking at?  Well, it's a graph structure. What we've basically done with Connexi  is we've parsed one for over 450,000 different papers across all aspects of academia  with the primary focus and comparison for the sake of this demo.  From there, we're able to identify key articles and publishments  that are actually representative of the greater field.

Well, that's where the beauty of the graph structure comes in.  Using graph structural elements such as the depth of the graph  or different node features,  looking at closely-related neighbors  and their independent node properties,  we're able to develop relationships between these graphs.  And as you can see, we can sort of parse that  and identify the points of research  that are absolutely essential for the development of growth  and that can propel us to solve the location problem  in capital allocation.  And another point of this as well is that  this is also a very robust model  where we can add any kinds of nodes that we want.  So say that I want to add my own node.  We have this little feature of,  you can copy any article on the internet  and we're gonna paste it as an additional node.  And once we submit it,  we've developed a web security technique  that's gonna give us metadata about this article.  So this is from the DOI,  if you guys are researchers, you probably know what that is,  but it's just an- ",store/connexsci-live.mp4_60.mp4,"Using graph structural elements such as the depth of the graph or different node features,  looking at closely-related neighbors  and their independent node properties,  we're able to develop relationships between these graphs.

videos/connexsci-live_compressed.mp4,120,there are two people standing in front of a screen with a video on it, essentially and then we can take that and if you notice we also have search functionality that  allows you to see citations other figures and then there are links that allow you to see the  connections between this node and the rest of the network and at the bottom we can talk a little  more about a few challenges. Primarily this was the case with connections where if they're  arbitrary like publishers or specific authors they don't give real data. This is where COVID  comes in. Shout out to COVID by the way we love them so much. So we used two models we code here  actually. Our main goal was to create an embedding which would allow us to compare two documents  together or the abstracts of two documents together to create or predict new edges in the graph.  So first off we would essentially extract a topic from an abstract using a method known as  entity extraction and from that we created our own ,store/connexsci-live.mp4_120.mp4,We used two models we code here actually.

And that allowed us to use a metric known as cosine similarity  to measure the angle between two word vectors or document vectors  and place them as new edges or update the weights of edges on this graph  to make it more accurate and richer  with context based on the semantics of the document.  Yeah, so how do we actually invest in these research papers?  So essentially we have a quadratic funding model  which essentially allows, or essentially expands,  I guess you could say the stakeholders in the research market  ranging from students to organizations to even companies  to get into the world of academia.  So how does the quadratic funding model actually work in this case?  Essentially, let's just say given a research company ",store/connexsci-live.mp4_180.mp4,The model is based on a quadratic funding model. It allows stakeholders in the research market ranging from students to organizations to even companies to get into the world of academia.
videos/connexsci-live_compressed.mp4,240,there are two men standing in front of a screen with a presentation on it," What's going to actually end up happening is that the amount of money they actually make  is going to be the summation of all the contributions from contributors.  Well, what about Monopoly? Because Monopoly is a core con of the quadratic, well, formula,  not formula, sorry, the quadratic funding.  So what we've implemented is a taxation system,  where we take a percentage or some percentage of what they make  and they crowdfund into contributors,  allowing a lot of small researchers to gain an equal chance to grow  as well as also be spotlighted throughout the whole world.  All right, and most importantly, our tech stacks.  So first of all, we have a new shinde here.  We're doing machine learning. I want to put it up there.  Myself, I worked on the interface,  and we have Jaybo right here who worked on the graph and math.  Above all, we're going to increase the value of public research  in the public sector and just put the public to it.  So my name is Roger Nagel.  And my name is Dave Patel.
