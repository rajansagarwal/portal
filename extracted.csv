One thing we wanted to talk about is academia.  So, in exploring research, we saw two main problems.  The first one was that most investments in scientific research failed to materialize.  And this was supposed to be on a capital allocation.  Another big part was funding demand participants received  over the past about 20 years or so has been inversely proportional.  So, we really want to solve that.  So, after pivoting our ideas six times, here we are with ConnectSci.  Yeah, so you might be wondering, well, what is this that you're looking at?  Well, it's a graph structure.  What we've basically done with ConnectSci is we've parsed the web  for over 450,000 different papers across all aspects of academia  with the primary focus in computer science for the sake of this demo.  From there, we're able to identify key articles and publishments  that are actually representative of the greater field.

Well, that's where the beauty of the graph structure  comes in using graph structural elements  such as the depth of the graph or different node features  looking at closely related neighbors  and their independent node properties.  We're able to sort of develop  relationships between these graphs.  And as you can see, we can sort of parse that  and identify the points of research  that are absolutely essential for the development of growth  and that can propel us to solve the location problem  in capital allocation.  And another point of this as well  is that this is also a very robust model  where we can add any kinds of nodes that we want.  So say that I wanna add my own node.  We have this little feature of,  you can copy any article on the internet  and we're gonna paste it as an additional node.  And once we submit it,  we've developed a web scripting technique  that's gonna give us metadata about this article.  So this is from the DOI, which if you guys are researchers,  you probably know what that is,  but it's just an index.

Yeah, so how do we actually invest in these research  figures? So essentially we have a quadratic funding model which essentially allows or  essentially expands the, I guess you could say the stakeholders in the research market ranging  from students to organizations to even companies to get into the world of academia. So how does  the quadratic funding model actually work in this case? Essentially, let's just say given a research company ",store/fragment_180.mp4,"Coheir uses a metric known as cosine similarity to measure the angle between two word vectors or document vectors and place them as new edges.

Well, what about Monopoly? Because Monopoly is a core con of the quadratic, well, the formula,  or not formula, sorry, the quadratic funding.  So what we've implemented is a taxation system where we take a percentage or a certain percentage  of what they make and they crowdfund it to contributors, allowing a lot of small researchers  to gain an equal chance to grow as well as also be spotlighted throughout the whole world.  Alright, and most importantly, our tech stack. So first of all, we have Anu Shinde here.  We're doing machine learning. Wonderful job there.  Myself, I work on the interface, and we have Jabo right here who works on the graph and math.  Above all, we're getting a recent IU of public research in the public sector and for the public good.  So my name is Raja Nagpal.  And my name is Dave Patel. ",store/fragment_240.mp4,The amount of money they actually make is going to be the summation of all the contributions from contributors.
